This is my third git file. Want to check the difference b/w workingcopy, stage and repository. And again making changes after moving to stage and before commiting to repository. Want to check the git diff --cached. Making some changes in the working copy and without adding to stage , I want commit directly. 
When tried this is not possible. I just added it to the stage and after that I am making some changes here. Now my working copy is different, my stage is different and my repository is different. Now I will try to commit and after that check the result. 
I have commited changes to the repository then only changes in the stage were comnmited. Working copy change are still there.
Once again  checking the above scenario.
